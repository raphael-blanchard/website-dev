## Tartan Air Datasets

This benchmark is based on the [TartanAir dataset](http://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/), which is collected in photo-realistic simulation environments based on the AirSim project. A special goal of this dataset is to focus on the challenging environments with changing light conditions, adverse weather, and dynamic objects. The four most important features of our dataset are:

   - **Large size diverse realistic data.** We collect the data in diverse environments with different styles, covering indoor/outdoor, different weather, different seasons, urban/rural.
   - **Multimodal ground truth labels.** We provide RGB stereo, depth, optical flow, and semantic segmentation images, which facilitates the training and evaluation of various visual SLAM methods. 
   - **Diversity of motion patterns.**  Our dataset covers much more diverse motion combinations in 3D space, which is significantly more difficult than existing datasets.
   - **Challenging Scenes.** We include challenging scenes with difficult lighting conditions, day-night alternating, low illumination, weather effects (rain, snow, wind and fog) and seasonal changes.Please refer to the TartanAir Dataset and the paper for more information.

# Evaluation (@ Wenshan)
The submission will be ranked based on completeness of the trajectory as well as on the position accuracy (ATE).

1. The following metrics will be used to evaluate the SLAM algorithms' performance:

For a known ground truth trajectory ME000_gt.txt and an estimated trajectory ME000_est.txt, we calculate the translation and rotation error based on the normalized Relative Pose Error similar to the KITTI dataset. Different from KITTI, we compute translational and rotational errors for all possible subsequences of length (5, 10, 15, ...,40) meters.  The translational error and rotational error are then combined to the final score:  , where we use  to balance the two errors, because the average rotation speed (in degree) is 7 times bigger than the average translation speed on our dataset. 

Due to the scale ambiguity of the monocular image, a global scale factor is calculated before the error computation. 

2. Download the evaluation tools. (TODO)

    Download the tartanair_tools repository, and follow the instruction here. 


## Submit the results. 

### Prepare the trajectory
For each of the 5 trajectories of **visual-inertial track**, you need to compute the **poses in IMU coordinate frame**, and save them in the text file with the name sequnce_name.txt. Put all 5 files into a zip file with the following structure: 

```
    visual_inertial_track.zip
    |
    --- ME000.txt                             # result file for the trajectory ME000 
    --- ME001.txt                             # result file for the trajectory ME001
    |          ..
    |          ..
    --- ME007.txt                             # result file for the trajectory ME007
    |       
    --- MH000.txt                             # result file for the trajectory MH000
    --- MH001.txt                             # result file for the trajectory MH001
    |          ..
    |          ..
    --- MH007.txt                             # result file for the trajectory MH007 
```


The text file should have the following format: 

```
# timestamp_s tx ty tz qx qy qz qw
1.403636580013555527e+09 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

```

The camera pose file should have the same format as the ground truth file in the training data. It is a text file containing the translation and orientation of the camera in a fixed coordinate frame. Note that our automatic evaluation tool expects the estimated trajectory to be in this format. 

- Each line in the text file contains a single pose.
- The number of lines/poses must be the same as the number of image frames in that trajectory. **(TODO: do we need this assumption? @wenshan)**  
- The format of each line is 'tx ty tz qx qy qz qw'. 
- tx ty tz (3 floats) give the position of IMU sensor to the world origin in the world frame.
- qx qy qz qw (4 floats) give the orientation of IMU in the form of a unit quaternion with respect to the world frame. 
- The trajectory can have an arbitrary initial position and orientation. However, we are using the IMU frame to define the motion. That is to say, the x-axis is pointing to forward, the y-axis is pointing left, the z-axis is pointing up.
